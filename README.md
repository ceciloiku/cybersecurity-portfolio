# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Blue Team / SIEM

I’m transitioning from Data Science & Analytics into Blue Team Security roles. This repo contains **sanitized case investigations** and **home labs** focused on logs, detections, and reporting.

## Target roles
- Blue Team Security Analyst
- SIEM / Log Analyst
- Microsoft 365 Security Analyst

## Featured work (start here)
## Case investigations
- [Project 01 — Phishing → PowerShell Execution → Tool Retrieval → DNS Exfiltration](case-investigations/project-01-phishing-investigation/)
- [Project 03 — Phishing → HTA Execution → Lateral Movement → DCSync Attempt (ELK)](case-investigations/project-03-elk-phishing-to-ransomware/)
- [Project 04 — Joomla Web Server Compromise & Defacement (Splunk)](case-investigations/project-04-joomla-defacement-splunk/)

## Mini investigations
- [P02 — Backdoor User + Encoded PowerShell C2 (Splunk)](case-investigations/mini-investigations/p02-backdoor-user-encoded-powershell-splunk-practice/)
- [P04 — Sysmon EVTX Investigation Practice](case-investigations/mini-investigations/p04-sysmon-evtx-investigation-practice/)

## Home labs
- [Lab 02 — Sysmon vs Windows Event Logs](home-labs/labs-02-sysmon-vs-winevent-logs/)
- [Lab 04 — Splunk Alert (Sysmon Network Connection)](home-labs/labs-04-splunk-alert-sysmon/)
- [Lab 05 — Splunk Dashboard](home-labs/labs-05-splunk-dashboard/)
- [Lab 06 — Sentinel Analytics Rules (KQL)](home-labs/labs-06-sentinel-kql-analytics-rules/)

## Repo map
- **Case investigations:** `case-investigations/`
- **Mini investigations:** `case-investigations/mini-investigations`
- **Home labs:** `home-labs/`

## Skills demonstrated
- Log triage & investigation using endpoint + network telemetry
- Detection logic and hunting queries (SPL, Kibana KQL, Sentinel KQL)
- SIEM dashboards and scheduled alert rules (Splunk/Sentinel)
- Clear reporting: timeline → evidence → findings → remediation recommendations

## Notes
All screenshots and artifacts are **sanitized** (no training-platform answers/flags, no sensitive identifiers).

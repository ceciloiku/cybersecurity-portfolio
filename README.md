# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Blue Team / SIEM

I’m transitioning from Data Science & Analytics into Blue Team Security roles. This repo contains **sanitized case investigations** and **home labs** focused on logs, detections, and reporting.

## Target roles
- Blue Team Security Analyst
- SIEM / Log Analyst
- (Optional track) Microsoft 365 Security Analyst

## Featured work (start here)
### Case investigations
- Boogeyman 1–3 (IR-style reports)
- Benign (Splunk investigation)
- ItsyBitsy (ELK investigation)

### Home labs
- Wireshark Packet Capture — Mini Lab
- Sysmon vs Windows Event Logs — Mini Lab
- Splunk: Ingest Windows Logs + Dashboard + Alert

## Repo map
- **Case investigations:** `case-investigations/`
- **Home labs:** `home-labs/`

## What I can do
- Investigate alerts using endpoint + network logs
- Write SPL / Kibana queries and detection logic
- Build dashboards and document findings clearly (timeline → evidence → conclusion)

## Notes
All screenshots and artifacts are **sanitized** (no training-platform answers/flags, no sensitive identifiers).
